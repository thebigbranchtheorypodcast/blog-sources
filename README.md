`hugo server`

## :rocket: Deploy

Current **public** folder is a [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules) that points to [generated sources repository](https://github.com/thebigbranchtheorypodcast/thebigbranchtheorypodcast.github.io), so to deploy the site you must build and then commit and push within the submodule

1. `hugo`
2. `cd public`
3. `git add .`
4. `git commit -m "A commit message"`
5. `git push`
